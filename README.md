# NOMAD Tajine Documentation

This repository hosts the specific documentation for the NOMAD Tajine Example Oasis.

## Contributing

- Typos, corrections, and missing docs can be reported by [Creating an Issue](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-docs/issues/new)

- For internal contributions (write access to the repo required), please open a pull request (PR) with your changes. **At least one review from a FAIRmat co-worker is required before merging**. If you are not sure who to assign, please ask in the PR conversation by tagging @ahm531 or @JFRudzinski.

- For external contributions, please follow the [External Contribution Instructions](#external-contribution-instructions)

- Any contributions that should end up in the next documentation release should target the `develop` branch. When a new version of the NOMAD software is released, the current state of the `develop` branch will be merged into `main` with a corresponding version tag: this way the documentation can be synced with NOMAD versions. **Note that you should not merge documentation for features that will not be included in the next release**: keep them in another branch.

## Running the Docs Server Locally

If you have a `nomad-dev-distro` setup, you can follow the [day to day development](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-distro-dev?tab=readme-ov-file#day-to-day-development) instructions to install `nomad-docs` as a submodule there.

If you *do not* have an up-to-date Python installation (3.11 or 3.12), see [Help to install Python](#help-to-install-python-311-or-312) below.

### 1. Install uv

#### (a) Standalone

##### On macOS and Linux`

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

##### On Windows

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
Or, from PyPI:
```

#### (b) With pip

```bash
pip install uv
```

#### (c) With pipx

```bash
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

### 2. Run the Local Docs Server

Once `uv` is installed, you can start the MkDocs server with:

```bash
uv run mkdocs serve
```

This will install all requirements in a virtual environment and start the local development server.

> 💡 **Tip:** To compare your local docs with the latest version once you start making significant changes, use the [DEV Deployment DOCS](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/develop/docs/index.html).

### How to run the tests

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest
```

## Automated Tests

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically run a series of tests on every push and pull request to the `main` branch. These tests ensure the quality and integrity of the documentation.

### 1. Link Check

This test checks for broken links in all markdown files (`.md`) within the `docs` and `examples` directories, as well as in the `README.md` file. This ensures that all internal and external links are valid and accessible.

### 2. Documentation Build

This test builds the MkDocs documentation using the `--strict` flag. This flag treats any warnings as errors, ensuring that the documentation is always in a buildable state.

### 3. Pytest

This test runs the `pytest` command to execute all the tests in the `tests` directory. This test runs the `pytest` command to execute all the tests in the `tests` directory. These tests include:

- `test_assets.py`: This test ensures there are no unused assets (e.g., images, data files) in the `docs/` directory by checking if they are referenced in any Markdown files.
- `test_docs.py`: This test verifies that the documentation pages are served correctly, checking for proper HTTP status codes and cache headers.
- `test_pydantic.py`: This test checks helper functions that extract information from Pydantic models, which are used to automatically generate documentation for these models.
- `test_metainfo.py`: This test checks helper functions that extract information from NOMAD's Metainfo models, which are used to automatically generate documentation for these models.
